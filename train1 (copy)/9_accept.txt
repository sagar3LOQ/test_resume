Project Walkthrough



Title

Predicting No-Shows for revenue optimization through overbooking                                                

Client

Leading Airline in Airline Sector

Project Description

Frequent practice in the airline industry is to overbook flights to make up for losses caused by absent passengers (also called no-shows). The focus of this case was to build models and understand the effects of various flight and passengers characteristics on No Show rate.

Approach

Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes Classifier and Logistic Regression to predict  whether the passenger will be a show or a no-show based on the attributes like Departure Time , Gender, Aircraft Type, Departure Airport, Booking Class etc.

Achievement

Appreciation from top management for predicting No-Shows with good accuracy and developing the model in a very short span of time.

Environment and Languages worked on

Office Automation

R, Base SAS and SPSS

MS Office (Excel, Power Point, Word)



Title

Predicting factors influencing flight delays

Client 

Leading Airline

Project Description

Flight delays are a major problem within the airline industry and a minute reduction per flight could save $1.2 million in annual crew costs and $5 million in annual fuel savings for a midsized airline.  Build the models to predict the flight delays and delay time for a prominent mid-sized airline. For data-mining purpose, used R to develop models for predicting flight delays based on various attributes of a particular flight. The dataset contained 2,50,000 flights and 50 variables.

Approach

Classification and Regression tree (CART) algorithm used to depict the co-dependent factors (Location of the Airport, Time of Departure, Flying Distance, Aircraft Type etc.) causing flight delays

Logistic Regression to predict whether or not a given departure will be delayed or on-time

Mutinomial Logistic regression or CART to create models that predict the flight delay interval

Responsibilities

Prepared the case study to provide the business insights for the clients

Performed the coding in R for analysis

Environment and Languages worked on

R and SAS





Title

Seat Inventory Forecasting

Client

Leading Airline in the Indian Sector

Project Description

Inventory is a perishable good, so an airline wants to sell all the tickets before the departure of the flight

The center of the analysis was on forecasting seat inventory (booked count) based on the prior days booked count which gives an ability to airline to provide promotional offers so that the flight is fully filled at the time of departure.

Approach

	SVM, Neural Networks and Ensemble Learning

	Time Series/ Panel data modeling to forecast the booked count based on the prior days buckets

Environment and Languages worked on

R, MINITAB, ITSM





Title

POC on Mining Twitter for Airline Consumer Sentiment and classifying tweets

Project Description

Text Mining for mining twitter data to check the customer sentiment for airlines by using R

Unsupervised learning to identify network of terms based on their co-occurrence in the same

Classifying the tweets based on the terms shared by them

Social Network Analysis

Environment and Languages worked on

R packages used (twitteR, plyr, stringR, tm, ggplot, flemix, nnet, fpc etc.)
