Project Description:



This journey started a couple of years ago with the identification of a market need, Vision and Creating a Grounds up Vertical Solution (MOVES), strategizing how to disrupt the existing market, showcasing the solution at international conferences, partnering and pushing the solution using Microsoft relationship and sales force, showing real business value and addressing pain points of customers.

This is basically a renovation of moves portal demo which had won by tech Mahindra with a good competition in US sector.









Contribution:

	

	Responsibility to Create HTML Mockups.

	Interface Designing of screens. Making HTML Builds.

	Thorough testing of HTMLs developed in all major Browsers.

	We had won the moves portal for the state of New Hampshire for division of motor vehicles.

	

	

With this, we have entered a space dominated by large US-based SI companies - Deloitte, Hewlett Packard, 3M,  Accenture and FAST Enterprises

Other India Inc companies (TCS, Infosys, HCL) have been struggling to get into similar large US State-wide solution-based implementations for years without much success

In Public Sector space, this allows us to establish ourselves as a large Global Technology company that can solve real-world customer business problems using our own IP/solution (MOVES)

The solution is repeatable in every state in US, Canada and throughout the world for Motor Vehicle agencies and Licensing Agencies.

Every repeat solution sale (worldwide) will be of the order of $20-25M on an average
