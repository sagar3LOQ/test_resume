MASTERS THESIS
Thesis Title: Analysis of laugh signals for automatic spotting and synthesis
Advisor: Prof. B. Yegnanarayana
Abstract: The main aim of this work is to propose new set of features which are specific only to
laughter. Using these features, a method for discriminating laughter from speech is proposed. The
features were also tested using Neural networks (quicknet), SVM (libsvm) etc. A method for
synthesizing natural human like laughter was also proposed.

PROJECTS
• Automatic Medical Coding (April '13- till date)
Technologies: Python, Matlab, Shell scripting, C++
Abstract: Project aims at building an automatic medical coding system which takes medical documents (in
radiology, consultation domains) as input and extracts the medical codes from it. The system first does a
two-pass sentence segmentation (not clean data) to identify valid sentence boundary using logistic regression
and then does a classification of whether a word needs to be coded Though the task is very complicated in
general, it performs reasonably well for some simple domains like radiology, consultation. Also build word
vector based deep neural network models to convert between different code sets (ICD-9 to ICD-10, which is
not a direct one-one mapping).
• ASR for medical transcriptions using Sphinx, Kaldi (April '13-till date)
Technologies: Python, Perl, Shell scripting, C++
Abstract: The project involves building an ASR for medical transcriptions using Sphinx. Started from very
scratch of building the phoneset (including non-speech phones etc), preparing transcription rules.
Experimented with various Acoustic modeling techniques, Language modeling techniques (RNNs, Ngram
based with Kneser Ney smoothing etc ), g2p techniques (Joint Sequence models). Build grammars for
numbers, dates, names, medicine dosages etc for LM.
• ASR, TTS clients for Linux, Android, windows
Technologies: C++, Android, Java, Python
Abstract: Built clients for recording audio, transfer the audio to the servers using XMLRPC protocol and get the
results in popular operating systems like Linux, Windows and Android..
• Building multi-accent Acoustic Models for English (Cisco funded) (July '12 – Dec '12)
Technologies: Perl, Shell scripting, C++
Abstract: Goal of the project is to build multi-accent (US+UK+AUS) acoustic models for English. Used AMI,
ICSI, ISL, NIST data-sets for producing preliminary results. Data preparation and lexicon generation has been
performed for all (as well as combined) data-sets and trained LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis ) +
MLLT(Maximum likelihood linear transform) based models using kaldi. Lexicon was build by automatically
downloading pronunciations from dictionary websites (freedictionary.com, merriam websters dictionary etc).
For the unknown words, pronunciations were extracted using g2p based on 'Joint sequence models'. Also
automatically Identified hesitations on an unclean data provided by cisco. This is achieved by modifying the
lexicon fst to add hesitation branch in between words, in kaldi framework. The models were tested with
standard test sets like rt04 etc.

• Patient Electronic medical records (Jan'11 – July '11)
Technologies: Perl, PHP, Shell scripting.
Abstract: The goal is to maintain the patient diagnosis records in a structured way so that they can be later
used for suggesting the medications automatically, generating reminders to the patients etc. Involved in
developing the back-end NLP work. Used “Metamap” software to automatically identify the concepts from the
records and extracted the Snomed codes out of it. Implemented scripts to convert the Snomed CT codes to
ICD-9 and ICD-10 and viceversa.
• Speech server based on kaldi (April'11 – Dec '11)
Technologies: C++, HTML/PHP
Abstract: Built a customized SGMM based ASR using Kaldi. The system can run multiple ASRs with each one
running on a different AM/LM. Implemented modules to supports user submitted grammars, which the system
compiles online and decodes the input using it. Both web interface and API based invocations are provided to
the client. Additional features like load balancing, optimized model loading, garbage cleanup, secured client
licensing etc are also incorporated.
• Preparing domain specific language models (Jan '12 – April '12)
Technologies: C++, Perl, Shell scripting, HTML/PHP
Abstract: Built recognizers for domains like Dates, Indian Cities names, Songs, Telephone numbers etc. The
main task here is to write grammars for the respective domains. It is first proof checked with Perl/shell scripts
and then later implemented in C++. The system parses the grammar files, compile them individually and finally
combine them to get the final language model (in the form of fst) for that domain. For the grammars like dates,
we tweaked with the probabilities so that it gives better performance for a particular task.

Web based Text-to-Speech for Indian Languages (August '10 – March '11)
Technologies: C++, Perl, Shell scripting, HTML/PHP
Abstract: Built a Text-to-Speech system for Hindi, Telugu and Hinglish (Hindi and English combined) using
festival/festvox framework with duration and pitch modeling. Have tried both rule based and statistical based
methods for grapheme to phoneme conversion. The system works for both itrans and unicode inputs. Build
web interfaces for both TTS and Perceptual evaluation. The system is also deployed in server-client mode
(using xmlrpc protocols)
• Ultra-low bit rate speech coder (Dec ‘09 – July '10)
Technologies: Matlab, Shell scripting
Abstract: The goal of the project is to build an Ultra-low bit rate coder. Implementations of commonly used
vocoders like CELP, MELP are understood. The source coding is performed in two frame works: a)
improvements over CELP excitation and b) better modeling residual, while the system is encoded using vector
quantization (VQ) on LSP’s.

Segmenting and labeling speech using signal characteristics (Dec ‘07 – April’ 08)
Technologies: Matlab, Shell scripting
Abstract: Automatic segmentation methods available in literature try to force align the transcript and the
corresponding speech utterance. A different approach which doesn't force align the text was proposed in this
study. The main idea of the proposed method is to segment whatever that is possible to segment from speech
signal only and then align the transcripts to the segments. Using energy in low frequency band and high
frequency band, three types of segments are reliably identified from speech signals: voiced, unvoiced and
fricatives. An automatic segmentation algorithm for Indian languages is proposed.
• Concatenative TTS System for Indian Languages from limited database(July ’07 – Dec ‘07)
Technologies: Perl, Shell scripting
Abstract: The goal of this work is to build a unit selection based concatenative TTS system for Indian
languages. The idea of a generic system came from the fact that all the Indian languages share a similar
phone set and phonetic rules with little exceptions. The novelty in the work is that we used some acoustic
phonetic properties specific to Indian languages to reduce the training database.

• IL-IL Machine Translation System (Dec ‘06 – April ‘07)
Technologies: Perl, Shell scripting
Abstract: Machine Translation from one Indian Language to other is an interesting work to work on. The
advantage of Indian Language (IL) to IL system is that they are from the same origin and so the grammar is
similar excepting a few. Presently it is a rule based model depending on Morph Analyzers, Dictionaries and
Transfer Grammar Rules.
