Profile______________________________________________________________________________

Strong background on Machine Learning, Predictive Modelling and rich experience of its successful application to
real life problems arise under various contexts. Six years of experience in advanced statistics and high dimension
analytics, including managerial position.
Range of Experience:

Statistical Methods - Bayesian Model (MonteCarlo), Logistic Regression, Time Series Model
Machine Learning - Boosted Methods, Random Forest, Clustering, A-B test (MAB)
Stochastic Methods- Optimization techniques and Regularization techniques

Academic Qualification and Projects:
Master of Statistics(Hons.)(2005-07)
Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata
Master Thesis (Machine learning-Ensemble Methods) widely appreciated for its comprehensive and in-depth
analysis

Statistical learning- Extensively researched on Ensemble learners, methods of combining decision rules in
an optimal way. One of the main objectives of using aggregated classifiers is learning highly complex nonlinear decision surfaces and tests its efficacy in large dimension, computationally almost infeasible in parametric set
up.
Stochastic Optimization – Application of various stochastic optimization techniques in prediction and
Classification. A case study to analyze A/B test(as a multi arm Bandit problem) and its alternatives.
Time series modelling - A detail study of parametric approach to model financial time series and their
corresponding advantages and disadvantages. ARCH and GARCH are explored extensively to model stock
volatility

Bachelor of Statistics(Hons.)(2002-05)
Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata
● Multivariate and Regression techniques - Application of parametric/non-parametric (PCA, regularization),
smoothing techniques in real world data.
● Classification among different kangaroo Species - A Case study involving parametric and non parametric
techniques. Obtained a decision rule which works better than traditional parametric and non parametric
methods.

Professional Experience and Major Projects:
Morgan Stanley, Mumbai
May’08 – Apr’13
Quantitative Research Group in Risk department – Worked as a manager (Sr. Statistician), taking care of research,
model-validation/maintenance and queries of exiting models; other responsibilities include mentoring junior
members.
●

Extensive analysis of e-trading portfolio (PDT) to access risk arising from mass transaction and high volatile
period. Optimal prediction of signal against noise in sparse data.

Developed and analyzed Gaussian copula model (IRC) to include correlation, default, liquidity and other risks
(mainly in credit) which are not captured by traditional VaR approach. Also performed sensitivity and stress
analysis.
Developed and tested various alternative risk measures like Conditional volatility VaR measure and improved
marginal VaR as local kernel regression.
Bayesian Analysis(MCMC) of (CEV) for various risk factors to correctly estimate risk charge as a validation
exercise of various model. A comprehensive study to estimate CEV parameters.
Tested Principle component approach (PCA) to model EQ volatility(Term) move to calculate VaR. And
modelled (conditional volatility) FX-vol time series.
Statistical (extensive regression and time-series) analysis to explain any significant changes in portfolio risk
measure.

Gridstone Research, Mumbai
Recommended as an excellent researcher and a very innovative member of core R&D group

July’07 - May’08

●

High Dimension Analytics - This project was to detect natural patterns that arise in massive data set in
context of text classification and clustering.
 Classification - A detailed study of various models (EnsembleMethods, NB, SVM, Logistic) on real
dataset, comparing their performance on many parameters
 Clustering - Applied Subspace clustering to various dataset to understand the pattern within class and
between classes. In large data-size, cluster-validation is another challenge; it was dealt with novel use of
Bootstrap.

●

Feature Extraction - A project to come up with a reduced dimension and meaningful feature extraction.
Extracted features (grouped, individual) were very useful in rule based model.

●

Rare Event Classification - Project to develop a strategy for rare group classification. The crux of the
project was to deal with lack of enough training data and prediction of extremely complex decision boundary.
